object relational mapping
--------------------------

ORM is a programming technique that allows developers to work with relational databases using high-level object-oriented concepts, rather than directly writing SQL queries. With ORM, database tables are represented as classes, and rows in those tables are represented as instances of those classes. This abstraction simplifies database interactions and makes it easier to manipulate data within an application.

how ORM works:

1.Mapping Database Tables to Classes: In an ORM system, each database table is mapped to a corresponding class in the application's code. The class definition typically includes attributes that represent the table's columns.

2.Instances as Rows: When data is retrieved from the database, it is returned as instances of these classes. Each instance represents a row in the database table, and its attributes correspond to the values in the columns of that row.

3.Object-Oriented Querying: Instead of writing raw SQL queries, developers can use the ORM's query interface to perform database operations. Queries are expressed using object-oriented syntax, making them more intuitive and easier to read.

4.Automatic SQL Generation: Behind the scenes, the ORM translates object-oriented queries into SQL queries that are executed against the database. This allows developers to work with high-level abstractions while still leveraging the power of SQL.
